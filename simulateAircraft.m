% simulateAircraft.m
% function to simulate a fixed wing aircraft modeled by faircraft function
% usage

%   tfinal : final simulation time (s)
%   x0 : x = [pe0; Phi0; Vb0; Omegab0] : state vector
%   delta = [deltat; deltaf;ih;deltae;deltaa;deltar]Â´  
%   with
%     deltat : propulsion system control (0<=deltat<=1)
%     deltaf : flaps (rad) 
%     ih : horizontal tail incidence
%     deltae : elevator (rad) NOTE: + if right aileron goes down
%     deltaa : aileron (rad)
%     deltar : rudder(rad)
%   Vwe: wind velocity expressed in earth frame (m/s) 
%   deltaCGb: relative cg position respect no nominal cg expressed in body frame
%   aircraft: aircraft data structure
%   t: time vector (s)
%   X: matrix such that row i is x' for time t(i)
